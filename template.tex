\section{Work Experience and Internships}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{Since Jan'19}{Data Analyst - OpEx co-op}{Teck Resources Ltd., Sparwood BC}{
	- Worked with predictive maintenance team to develop and deploy Machine learning models (primarily Auto-encoders) that can predict the current health status and remaining life of the bearings installed on the mining equipment
	\\- Developed a module in python to pre-process the collected data from the sensors and use it to train a deep learning network (RNN with Auto-encoder developed in Pytorch)
	\\- Attained an accuracy of 96\% by long term training and testing, decreasing unforeseen maintenance cost by a significant amount
	\\- Analyzed the mining data and built visualizations to help generate value from the data, increase production and optimize processes
	\\- Created custom measures in DAX to explain the cause of the underlying problem and to assist in discovering solutions
	\\- Worked on automating the forecasting process using python scripts performing data cleansing, statistical analysis and forecasting using open-source libraries in python}
	
	\twentyitem{Apr-July'18}{AI Researcher - AgBot competition}{Nexus Robotics, Halifax NS}{- Contributed to Award winning (AgBOT challenge '18 at Purdue University) robot capable of identifying and plucking weed in a farm
	\\- Assisted the team in Transfer Learning of the dataset on pre-trained deep learning models (YOLO and ROLO)
	\\- Collected data and facilitated labelling of the data using openCV
	\\- Fine-tuned the learned model by introducing special test cases (data examples) to increase its accuracy and robustness}
	
	\twentyitem{Apr-Aug'17}{Research Intern - Oil Spill Detection}{DRDO,  New Delhi India}{- Developed a software module to detect and differentiate the type of petroleum liquid (or mixture) given its spectral information from a radar to be installed on the runway to identify oil leaks.
	\\- Performed cleaning of the spectral data (denoising and temporal adjustments) and calculated cross correlation to obtain similarity to the base spectrum
	\\- Integrated the final algorithm developed in R to Java API using \textit{rJava} package to show and monitor the results real-time in a web app}

%\section{Other information}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
